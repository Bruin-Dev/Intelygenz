Hi Nick,

While working on the forticloud auto-resolve user story I stumbled across some corner cases that involve the following situations:
- we failed adding a starting Triage note to a newly created ticket
- a Bruin user manually unresolves a previously auto-resolved service_number task

We mimicked the Ixia behaviour so that:
- if no previous notes are found on a ticket, the grace period to auto-resolve a Forticloud outage will be calculated taking the ticket creation date as a reference
  (when dealing with a normal case in which we correctly added a Triage or Reopen note, we calculate the grace period taking the last Triage or Reopen note as a reference).
- if a Bruin user manually changes3
