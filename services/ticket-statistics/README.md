# Description
This service is responsible for:
- calculating ticket statistics based on the ticket data stored by ticket-collector, and store them to the MongoDB instance.
- exposing a REST API that, upon receiving GET requests, makes it fetch a subset of ticket statistics calculated by the periodic cycle from the MongoDB instance. These statistics are used to build some custom Grafana dashboards (these dashboards are not in the Automationâ€™s Grafana instance, though).

# Workflow
__TODO__

# Capabilities used
This service is self-contained, i.e., it does not require access to NATS or Redis, or any other microservice within the Automation Engine.
