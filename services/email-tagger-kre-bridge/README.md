# Description
This microservice is in charge of making requests to the Email Tagger’s Konstellation Runtime Environment.
When a REQuester asks for a prediction of the best tag that can be assigned to an e-mail, the request payload goes through this service, which ultimately interacts with Email Tagger’s KRE.
