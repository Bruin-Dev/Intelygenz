# Description
This microservice is in charge of making requests to the Repair Ticket’s Konstellation Runtime Environment.
When a REQuester asks for a prediction of the best way an e-mail from one of MetTel’s customers can be processed to deal with an issue in a network device, the request payload goes through this service, which ultimately interacts with Repair Ticket’s KRE.
