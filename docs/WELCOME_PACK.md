## Project overview

### Resources

- Check docs folder inside the mettel gitlab project and read carefully the readme for installing all the required programs and configure the project.
- After RRHH's on-boarding our team lead will give an overview of the project <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y18vXn6lsSp-6pJVsB5swWg7UcTDWYrIYtXq8_brRMk/edit#slide=id.g6183830b53_0_5>

### Project guidelines

- This project uses Black and isort. You just need to install `pip install pre-commit` and then just run `pre-commit run --all-files` on the root folder.
Please check `pre-commit-config.yaml` for more info about it.
- Another option (after adding the project poetry env as interpreter in pycharm) would be running `poetry run black .` and `poetry run isort .` on the root folder, the config options will be taken automatically from `pyproject.toml`. For adding this as autosave option please refer to https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html
- When updating a git branch please use rebase instead of merge.
- If you update the project documentation please run `poetry run mkdocs serve -f mkdocs.yml` and check everything it displayed as expected, no broken links.
- Run codespell over the project to avoid any errata with the command `poetry run codespell -I .dictionary.txt --skip="./venv,./.git,*.json,*.svg,*.bpmn,*.vsdx,./databases"`.

### Tools

- k9s <https://k9scli.io/>
