#### 1.2 Implementation
To enforce the authorizations to access information and system resources, the project hast 4 groups, 2 privileged groups and another 2 groups with non privileged permisions. These groups are:
- OKTA-IPA-FED-INT-PRIVILEGED: Privileged MetTel users.
- OKTA-IPA-FED-INT-NON-PRIVILEGED: Non privileged MetTel users.
- OKTA-IPA-FED-EXT-PRIVILEGED: privileged contractor users.
- OKTA-IPA-FED-EXT-NON-PRIVILEGED: non privileged contractors users.

Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Web Service Security (WS Security), WS-Security Policy, WS Trust, WS Policy Framework, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)].
#### 1.2 Implementation
The enforced authorization are made by Okta and the groups configured in AWS Identity center. Only administrator groups can create/modify/delete information flows but is not recommended doing it in that way because almost everything was made with infrastructure as a code. All
the security groups are wrote on code and the modification of these securities groups should be made with git and a redeployment of the infrastructure.

# AC-6 Least Privilege

Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [all security functions (examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions)] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.
#### 3.2 Implementation
This is manually configured with specific groups on IAM Indentity center with no privileged credentials, these groups are asociated to users(from Okta), these are not allowed to execute or see privileged resources/functions.

#### 4. AC-6(5) Least Privilege | Privileged Accounts
#### 4.1 Description
Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [GSA S/SO or Contractor recommended employees and contractors as approved by the GSA CISO and AO].
#### 4.2 Implementation

#### 5. AC-6(10) Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions
#### 5.1 Description
Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.
#### 5.2 Implementation
This is manually configured with specific groups on IAM Indentity center with no privileged credentials, these groups are asociated to users(from Okta), these are not allowed to execute or see privileged resources/functions that should be visible only with privileges. The associated groups with no privilages are OKTA-IPA-FED-INT-NON-PRIVILEGED and OKTA-IPA-FED-EXT-NON-PRIVILEGED. More information about the groups [here](../manual_configurations/OKTA_CONFIGURATIONS.md#steps)


# AC-7 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
#### 1 Description
a. Enforce a limit of [not more than ten (10) failed access attempts] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a [30 minute time period]; and
b. Automatically [locks the account node for [30 minutes]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
#### 2 Implementation
The enforce of a limit on logon attemps is implemented by MetTel from Okta to access from IAM identity central. There are 2 main accounts needed from AWS that does not comes from Okta and Identity central, a MetTel main root account that has access to everything and a deployment account to deploy infra as a code. ItÂ´s not posible to limit the number of attempts because AWS does not support this [behaviour](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html#password-policy-rules).


# AC-8 System Use Notification
#### 1 Description
a.

1.        Users are accessing a U.S. Government system;
2.        System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
3.        Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
4.        Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;
b.        Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the system; and
c.        For publicly accessible systems:
1.        Displays system use information [when accessed via logon interfaces with human users], before granting further access;
2.        Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
3.        Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
#### 2 Implementation
The display of system use notifications are managed by MetTel and the laptops that they provide to access their systems. We don't have direct connexions to machines by SSH or any remote access to servers on this infrastructure.
