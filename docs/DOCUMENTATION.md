# 1. DOCS Organization
## Folder structure
* **diagrams**: In this folder you will encounter all the diagrams Intelygenz has done.
* **decisions**: Folder where Intelygenz store the decisions made by the team.
* **metrics-definitions**: Here is where all the metrics of the project are defined.
* **images**: Folder to store images to be use on other MD files.
* **logging**: 

# 2. Rules
* This is the Main source of truth.
* Docs must be in the docs folder.
* Always make atomic commits.
* All the documentation must be reviewed and approved.
* Before start the code of a new metric, document it, and work on it only after approved by another team member.
* Organization of the documentation matters. Discuss with your team where is the best place to put new stuff.
* Always link a new MD file in an index README.md where makes sense.
* Diagrams are important, before start coding a new system/infrastructure, update the diagrams.

# 3. Tools
### Diagrams
To create good diagrams centralized in the repository we use [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), this tool has plugins for the two main
IDE that the company use:
* [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration)
* [VSCode](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/embed-diagrams-vscode)
