# Intermapper Event Logging

# Description

The mission of this service is to analyze InterMapper events sent by one or more InterMapper instances via e-mail, where each
event refers to a device. The outcome of the analysis will determine whether:
* A new Bruin ticket is created, if the device is down.
* An existing Bruin ticket is re-opened, if the device is down and the ticket is resolved.
* An existing Bruin ticket is auto-resolved, if the device is up and the ticket is open.

When any of these cases take place, the event information is added to the ticket as a note. In some cases, this note can
be enriched with information from the DRI system.

Whatever the outcome of the analysis is, the event is finally marked as processed.
