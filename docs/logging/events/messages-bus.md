# Messages Bus Event Logging

# Description

The messages bus is the central piece of communication between the services living in the Automation system.

Services can talk to each other by publishing messages to subject. When a service has interest on a particular
subject, any messages published to that subject will be consumed by it.

The bus provides two communication models for these services:

  * Publish / Subscribe (a.k.a. PUB / SUB). As hinted above, a service publishes a message to a subject which is later
    consumed by another service with interest in that subject.

  * Request / Reply. In this case, a service asks for data by publishing a message to a subject which is later consumed
    by another service with interest in that subject. This is pretty much a PUB/SUB flow.

    The difference here, however, is that the consumer of the message will reply with a response to the requestor. The
    requestor takes care of consuming that response message once it gets it.

Since the messages bus will not allow publishing messages larger than 1MB+, and if necessary, all services take care of
storing them to a temporary storage so consumers can restore the original message on their end.

## List of Decisions made by the Messages Bus
### PUB-SUB workflow
|     | Condition                                   | Decision                                                   | Decision                                                     |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Check for message size before publishing it | Message is too large for the message bus to handle (1MB+)  | Message is small enough for the message bus to handle (<1MB) |

### REQUEST-REPLY workflow
#### Requestor
|     | Condition                                           | Decision                                                  | Decision                                                          |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Check for request message size before publishing it | Message is too large for the message bus to handle (1MB+) | Message is small enough for the message bus to handle (<1MB)      |
| 2   | Check for response message size before consuming it | Message has a token representing a large message (1MB+)   | Message does not have a token representing a large message (1MB+) |

#### Replier
|     | Condition                                            | Decision                                                  | Decision                                                          |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Check for request message size before consuming it   | Message has a token representing a large message (1MB+)   | Message does not have a token representing a large message (1MB+) |
| 2   | Check for response message size before publishing it | Message is too large for the message bus to handle (1MB+) | Message is small enough for the message bus to handle (<1MB)      |
